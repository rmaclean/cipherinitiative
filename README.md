# The ■■■■■■■■■ Initative 

There is a board game about spies, code cracking and having fun.

These are tools I wrote to help me solve puzzles.

It started with `yardsale.js` which I did to check why we kept getting 2 mistakes in the letters (we did have the right answer but somehow messed up 2 letters).

`secret7.js` was next, which we did manually first but I added to here incase it helps with one of the [unknowns](unknowns.md)

# Setup

Do a `nvm use` to set your version of node to match what I am using but it should "just work" with anything.

# Run

Just run a script through node, e.g. `node secret7.js`
